# What is hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

 * Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

 * Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
 * Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## How can a beginner participate?

If you’re new to open source (everyone was once!), take a look at our

[Introduction to Open Source series.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source)
Before you make your first contribution, you should familiarize yourself with [How To Create a Pull Request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

The following resources share repositories that curate tasks for beginners:

* [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

* [Issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/)

* [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

* [Your First PR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/)

* [Awesome for Beginners](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-beginners)

Once you start feeling more comfortable, you can find more open source projects through the following programs:

* [Pull Request Roulette](http://www.pullrequestroulette.com/)

* [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)

* [24 P[ull] R[equest]s](https://24pullrequests.com/)

* [This is another great guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) outlining ways you can contribute to open source.

## Event details

* Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Participation rules

To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 earned a shirt!)

## Quality standards

In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), here are examples of the PRs that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

* PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

* PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR)

* PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

* Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October

* Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.

## Values

Inspired by you – the community – through your actions and stories.

* Quantity is fun, quality is key! Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building. And it all begins with meaningful contributions to open source technology.

* Short-term actions, long-term impact! In the open source community, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. Your participation has a lasting effec
